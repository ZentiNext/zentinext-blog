She has her mask on <br>

And people wander<br>

Why such a good  heart goes<br>

Unnoticed and left to be alone<br>

But alas only she knows the truth<br>

She has the power to kill<br>

The disease inside her<br>

Is so powerful, if she let it<br>

It could destroy<br>

The most kindest hearts<br>

So she hides away<br>

With a false hope of keeping<br>

Her loved ones safe<br>

It's been a long time<br>

And she has forgotten<br>

Who she was before<br>

This is who she is now<br>

She has the power to kill<br>

But has no power to die<br>

So she suffers watching<br>

All the agony she has caused<br>

Lost souls screaming<br>

Her name for closure<br>

And she pretends not to hear them<br>

Cause she has to survive<br>

And to survive she needs to<br>

Wear the Mask.<br>
