She has her mask on

And people wander

Why such a good  heart goes

Unnoticed and left to be alone

But alas only she knows the truth

She has the power to kill

The disease inside her

Is so powerful, if she let it

It could destroy

The most kindest hearts

So she hides away

With a false hope of keeping

Her loved ones safe

It's been a long time

And she has frogotten

Who she was before

This is who she is now

She has the power to kill

But has no power to die

So she suffers watching

All the agony she has caused

Lost souls screaming

Her name for closure

And she pretends not to hear them

Cause she has to survive

And to survive she needs to

Wear the Mask.
