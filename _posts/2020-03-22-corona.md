She's gazing into his eyes,

And he's smiling. 

In each other's arms,

Her fire inside growing. 

I've missed you, she whispers,

As her body starts floating.

But deep down she knows, 

That time is running.

It's all over the news,

With the virus spreading.

And as he lands another kiss, 

She hears the alarm ringing.
