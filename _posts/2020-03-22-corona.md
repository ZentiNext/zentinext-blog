She's gazing into his eyes,<br>

And he's smiling.<br> 

In each other's arms,<br>

Her fire inside growing.<br> 

I've missed you, she whispers,<br>

As her body starts floating.<br>

But deep down she knows,<br> 

That time is running.<br>

It's all over the news,<br>

With the virus spreading.<br>

And as he lands another kiss,<br> 

She hears the alarm ringing.<br>
